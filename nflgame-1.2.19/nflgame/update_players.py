# Here's an outline of how this program works.
# Firstly, we load a dictionary mapping GSIS identifier to a dictionary of
# player meta data. This comes from either the flag `json-update-file` or
# nflgame's "players.json" file. We then build a reverse map from profile
# identifier (included in player meta data) to GSIS identifier.
#
# We then look at all players who have participated in the last week of
# play. Any player in this set that is not in the aforementioned mapping
# has his GSIS identifier and name (e.g., `T.Brady`) added to a list of
# players to update.
#
# (N.B. When the initial mappings are empty, then every player who recorded
# a statistic since 2009 is added to this list.)
#
# For each player in the list to update, we need to obtain the profile
# identifier. This is done by sending a single HEAD request to the
# `gsis_profile` URL. The URL is a redirect to their canonical profile page,
# with which we extract the profile id. We add this mapping to both of the
# mappings discussed previously. (But note that the meta data in the GSIS
# identifier mapping is incomplete.)
#
# We now fetch the roster lists for each of the 32 teams from NFL.com.
# The roster list contains all relevant meta data *except* the GSIS identifier.
# However, since we have a profile identifier for each player (which is
# included in the roster list), we can connect player meta data with a
# particular GSIS identifier. If we happen to see a player on the roster that
# isn't in the mapping from profile identifier to GSIS identifier, then we need
# to do a full GET request on that player's profile to retrieve the GSIS
# identifier. (This occurs when a player has been added to a roster but hasn't
# recorded any statistics. e.g., Rookies, benchwarmers or offensive linemen.)
#
# We overwrite the initial dictionary of player meta data for each player in
# the roster data, including adding new entries for new players. We then save
# the updated mapping from GSIS identifier to player meta data to disk as JSON.
# (The JSON dump is sorted by key so that diffs are meaningful.)
#
# This approach requires a few thousand HEAD requests to NFL.com on the first
# run. But after that, most runs will only require 32 requests for the roster
# list (small potatoes) and perhaps a few HEAD/GET requests if there happens to
# be a new player found.
