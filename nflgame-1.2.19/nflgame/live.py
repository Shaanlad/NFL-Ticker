"""
The live module provides a mechanism of periodically checking which games are
being actively played.

It requires the third party library pytz to be
installed, which makes sure game times are compared properly with respect
to time zones. pytz can be downloaded from PyPI:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz/

It works by periodically downloading data from NFL.com for games that started
before the current time. Once a game completes, the live module stops asking
NFL.com for data for that game.

If there are no games being actively played (i.e., it's been more than N hours
since the last game started), then the live module sleeps for longer periods
of time.

Thus, the live module can switch between two different modes: active and
inactive.

In the active mode, the live module downloads data from NFL.com in
short intervals. A transition to an inactive mode occurs when no more games
are being played.

In the inactive mode, the live module only checks if a game is playing (or
about to play) every 15 minutes. If a game is playing or about to play, the
live module switches to the active mode. Otherwise, it stays in the inactive
mode.

With this strategy, if the live module is working properly, you could
theoretically keep it running for the entire season.

(N.B. Half-time is ignored. Games are either being actively played or not.)

Alpha status
============
This module is emphatically in alpha status. I believe things will work OK for
the regular season, but the postseason brings new challenges. Moreover, it
will probably affect the API at least a little bit.

    Starts checking for games that are currently playing.

    Every time there is an update, callback will be called with three
    lists: active, completed and diffs. The active list is a list of
    game.Game that are currently being played. The completed list is
    a list of game.Game that have just finished. The diffs list is a
    list of `nflgame.game.GameDiff` objects, which collects statistics
    that are new since the last time `callback` was called. A game will
    appear in the completed list only once, after which that game will
    not be in either the active or completed lists. No game can ever
    be in both the `active` and `completed` lists at the same time.

    It is possible that a game in the active list is not yet playing because
    it hasn't started yet. It ends up in the active list because the "pregame"
    has started on NFL.com's GameCenter web site, and sometimes game data is
    partially filled. When this is the case, the 'playing' method on
    a nflgame.game.Game will return False.

    When in the active mode (see live module description), active_interval
    specifies the number of seconds to wait between checking for updated game
    data. Please do not make this number too low to avoid angering NFL.com.
    If you anger them too much, it is possible that they could ban your IP
    address.

    Note that NFL.com's GameCenter page is updated every 15 seconds, so
    setting the active_interval much smaller than that is wasteful.

    When in the inactive mode (see live module description), inactive_interval
    specifies the number of seconds to wait between checking whether any games
    have started or are about to start.

    With the default parameters, run will never stop. However, you may set
    stop to a Python datetime.datetime value. After time passes the stopping
    point, run will quit. (Technically, it's possible that it won't quit until
