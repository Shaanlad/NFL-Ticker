The results of the `compare-with-yahoo` script for the 2012 season.
The test is done by assuming a ground truth, which we take
from Yahoo for each position: http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/stats/byposition.
The output of the test is a mirror of the input: a new csv file for each
input csv file where the data represents the difference between nflgame's
statistics and Yahoo's statistics. They are reported in terms of the ground
truth. e.g., "5" means nflgame reports a number 5 more than Yahoo and
"-5" means nflgame reports a number 5 fewer than Yahoo. Consequently, "0"
means they agree exactly.
